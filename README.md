Allows you to run an exchange on any html hosting, no node, no php no docker.

is intended for the user who has few hosting features, virtually all traffic occurs between the client browser with the IPFS network and provider API, the host only provides only index.html and the *two small configuration files.

*We use two as an example, it may be more or just one.

In the configuration files the user can list their preferred currencies highlighted and define the API that will be used.

It is possible to load and make the page functional in less than 5 minutes.
